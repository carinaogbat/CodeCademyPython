#***QUESTION
# Write a function called unique_english_letters that takes the string word as a parameter. 
# The function should return the total number of unique letters in the string. Uppercase and
#  lowercase letters should be counted as different letters.

# Weâ€™ve given you a list of every uppercase and lower case letter in the English alphabet.
#  It will be helpful to include that list in your function.

#***MY SOLUTION***
letters = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
# Write your unique_english_letters function here:
def unique_english_letters(word):
  unique_letters = ''
  for letter in word:
    if letter in letters and letter not in unique_letters:
      unique_letters += letter
  return len(unique_letters)

# Uncomment these function calls to test your function:
print(unique_english_letters("mississippi"))
# should print 4
print(unique_english_letters("Apple"))
# should print 4

#***THEIR SOLUTION***
def unique_english_letters(word):
  uniques = 0
  for letter in letters:
    if letter in word:
      uniques += 1
  return uniques

#***QUESTION
# Write a function named count_char_x that takes a string named word and a single character 
# named x as parameters. The function should return the number of times x appears in word.

#   *** MY SOLUTION ***

# Write your count_char_x function here:
def count_char_x(word, x):
  count = 0
  for char in word:
    if char == x:
      count += 1
  return count


# Uncomment these function calls to test your tip function:
print(count_char_x("mississippi", "s"))
# should print 4
print(count_char_x("mississippi", "m"))
# should print 1
