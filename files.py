##using with open() vs open()
#it's better to open a file using the with block because everything indented inside the block will run and then close 
# the file when the block is closed. If you open just with open() the file will not close until you write close(). 
# This can impact performance as files exist outside of your Python script and other programs on your computer 
# may be trying to access the file.
